# Sales-Analysis Overview 
PROJECT OVERVIEW: This project involved creating an end-to-end ETL pipeline to extract, transform and load data from different sources to Staging and Production SQL Server Databases. To achieve the above, I wrote optimized SQL queries, and data extraction scripts in SSMS. Additionally, I used SSAS to create cubes for multi-dimensional analysis. These summary cubes were used to create dashboards and analyze data visualizations that drive decisions.
1. Business Scenario: A Grocery store requires an ETL Developer to migrate all the data from different sources to a central warehouse and develop dashboard that would help Sales Manager to:
a.	track product movement, as well as to see how sales are impacted by promotions.
b.	understand the mix of products in a customerâ€™s market basket.
c. 	frequency of channel POS device replacement
d.	know the effects of product rebranding on sales.
e. 	perform sales analysis on overall product brand sales and rebrand product sales.
f.	needs to know what the most demanded products for each time of the day are.
2. STEPS USED TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT

a. Restore the existing backup database:
The first step I took was to restore the database and create a conceptual, logical and the physical relational models to conform to requirements specification.
